Some time ago, the creativity that Web developers
          gave their designs today, they greatly inspired me
          and that is why I started my computer programming studies and
          web development, with the intention of dedicating myself to what became
          my greatest personal passion. So, over time, I've
          been specializing and adapting to the most current styles on the market,
          in order to capture the interest of a larger volume of customers.

I have successfully passed a bootcamp called <u>"Soy Henry"</u> at
          full-time level, developing as a Full Stack Developer, performing
          both individual and group projects which gave me the
          skills and knowledge to perform work of all kinds,
          learning the languages ​​mentioned to adapt to the market
          work, making a lot of emphasis on JavaScript and frameworks of both
          Front End as Back End.<br>
          In my learning path, I have carried out projects for clients and
          their respective items based on what the client demands and
          contributing ideas, using the best design tools
          adaptive (cell phones, tablets, notebooks, PC). Thus also like
          personal projects in order to practice. 
          My mentality is "always keep learning", not to let a day go by
          without learning something new and being able to advance in the quality of the sites
          websites I make, providing greater customer satisfaction.
